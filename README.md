# Basic Componen
## A. Game space
A full-screen web-page that shows the board games, question, and answer button.

## B. Boundaries
- The Game plays when the player clicks the start button.
- The board game consisting of 10 lives between player and computer that must be finished by the player with answering the questions.
- Scoring based on the quality of answers.

## C. Rule for Interaction
- The first step to start the game, the player must fill the login page by typing the student ID and password. If the Student ID and password entered correctly, the player will be directed to the Material map
- The map consists of 3 material (picture, function, and principle) that player must complete. The player can play the game with press the start button
- The game board. Player and computer have 10 lives. Choose the answer to the next question
- The player can start the game by answering the random picture that appears. The player must choose 1 answer from the options button
- The computer lives will be decreased if the player answers correctly
- Player lives decreased if the player chooses the wrong answer

## D. Artifacts
- Player's live
- Computer's Live
- Question
- Answer

## E. Goal
Result if the player completed the game. Player got information about the number of correct answers and the number of wrong answers and the final score

# Game Play
## A. Game's Rules
- The player wins if he is able to answer 10 questions correctly (computer live 0)
- The player loses when giving 10 wrong answers (player live 0)

## B. Plot
- The player must complete 3 material (picture, function, and principle) 
- Player against the computer by answering questions
- Player reduce computer life by answering questions correctly

## C. Objectives
- Choose the right answer to defeat the computer
- Get a high score with giving the wrong answer as little as possible
 
## D. Challenges
- Random question
- The player only has 10 lives which means the player only has 10 chances to choose the wrong answer
- The computer has 10 lives which means the player must provide 10 correct answers to defeat the computer

## E. Game Mechanics

1. Mobility
- A player choosing 1 of 3 material in the map to start the game
- The player can move to the next random question by choosing 1 of 4 option button at the bottom of the picture question
2. Question
- Each material consists of several questions.
- Each question consists of 4 answer choices button.
3. Scoring
- To provide an assessment of student achievement, this application processes data obtained from the work of player.

# Implementation and Testing
## A. Participants
- Participants form 4th-semester diploma IV at health polytechnic of Banjarmasin.
- Participants consisting of 1 male and 20 females

## B. Testing Method
- The application is run on a website. Application is distributed via internet networks.
- Participants use the application through their computer that is connected to the server via the internet.

## C. Evaluation Model
- In order to get feedback on the application, an evaluation is needed that explores how this application can have a positive impact on the participants. 
- There are 3 main things that are evaluated: 
1. Stress levels of participants when playing the game evaluation
2. Experience following a game-based learning evaluation
3. Experience following learning evaluation using random questions. 
- Each main things are described in 4 specific questions that are answered with a statement that strongly agrees, agrees, disagrees, strongly disagrees.
## Scoring Likert
- Max Score (Y) = Total Respondent * Max Score Likert
- Min Score (X) = Total Respondent * Min Score Likert
- Total Score = Sum (Total Responden * Score Likert)
- Index (%) = Total Score / Y * 100
- Interpretation
- 0 % - 24.99 % = Strongly Disagrees
- 25 % - 49.99 % = Disagrees
- 50% - 74.99 % = Agrees
- 75 % - 100 % - Strongly Agrees

# Result
## Instrument Picture Material
- 11 participantas get score 95.00
- 6 participantas get score 90.00
- 3 participantas get score 85.00
- 1 participantas get score 80.00
## Instrument Function Material
- 9 participantas get score 95.00
- 10 participantas get score 90.00
- 2 participantas get score 85.00
## Instrument Work Principle Material
- 11 participantas get score 95.00
- 4 participantas get score 90.00
- 3 participantas get score 85.00
- 2 participantas get score 80.00
- 1 participantas get score 75.00
## Stress Level
- 84.52 % participants didn't feel a dizzy / headache
- 86.90 % participants didn't feel nervous
- 86.90 % participants didn't feel anxious
- 77.38 % participants didn't feel the test is a burden
- 82.14 % participants didn't feel uptight
- Conclusion 83.568 % participants strongly agree the game-based didn't make stress

## Game-Based Learning Evaluation
- 80.95 % participants feel enjoy following the game-based learning evaluation
- 77.38 % participants feel more confident in following game-based learning evaluations than paper-based evaluation
- 77.38 % participants feel tension following evaluation of distracted learning with the game
- 80.95.38 % participants feel challenged to finish the game quickly
- 78.57 % participants feel that game-based evaluation is better than paper-based evaluation
- Conclusion 79.046 % participants strongly agree with Game-Based Learning Evaluation

## Learning Evaluation using Random Question
- 83.33 % participants feel curious about the question that appears next
- 82.14 % participants feel challenged to answer the question correctly
- 82.14 % participants feel happy when I can answer the questions correctly
- 78.57 % participants feel happy with the random question model compared to the predetermined question model
- 77.38 % participants feel the learning evaluation with random questions is more challenging than a predetermined question model
- Conclusion 80.712 % participants strongly agree with Learning Evaluation using Random Question 

# Conclusion
- A game-based method using a computer can be used as one of the alternatives for learning evaluation because it has several advantages : 
- Participants feel enjoy using game-based learning evaluation (reducing stress)
- Can help lecturer to check the score of students (immidiately known)
- Reducing costs to print question and answer sheet
- Give the participants maximum achievement
